# OpenQ-Api

### Description
OpenQ-API. Currently supports tvl indexing.

### Local Development
Set DATABASE_URL env variable to mongodb connection string. (I used mongodb atlas for testing).
Note that if you are using a local mongodb instance prisma requries replicas as well. 
`npm start`  to run.
Access graph api at localhost:4000
